# Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT Message Broker

[Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is a MQTT message broker to implement a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging model for M2M (machine to machine) telemetry in low-bandwidth environments. Allows to build IoT (Internet of Things) networks through interconnection of various instances and manage them with message interchange. 

## Eclipse Mosquitto Package Specifics

The current package is designed for the one-click Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT server setup. Upon its installation, a new environment with the following topology specifics is created: 
* contains a single Docker container with deployed [eclipse-mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/eclipse-mosquitto/) image (_latest_ tag)
* the default scaling limit for the Eclipse Mosquitto container is set to 8 dynamic cloudlets, i.e. up to _1 GiB_ of RAM and _3.2 GHz_ of CPU (can be manually adjusted through [topology wizard](https://docs.jelastic.com/setting-up-environment), if needed)
* a dedicated [endpoint](https://docs.jelastic.com/endpoints) is automatically created to make your message broker available from anywhere over Internet (a  [Public IP](https://docs.jelastic.com/public-ipv4) address can be manually attached after installation for production usage)

The Eclipse Mosquitto package is compatible with Jelastic of 5.0.6 version and higher.
